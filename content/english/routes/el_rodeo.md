#### Canyoning Tour at El Rodeo

---

Join us and enjoy a canyoning tour near Hacienda El Rodeo, Ciudad Colón!!!

No previous experience required!!!

Canyoning involves traversing the canyon or riverbed, overcoming obstacles encountered along the way. This journey includes multiple waterfalls where we engage in rappelling, with the highest one measuring 25 meters, in addition to natural river slides. After completing the canyon descent, a 20-minute walk along a trail leads us back to the vehicles.

Due to the nature of the trip, it has a Moderate difficulty level of 3/7, but it can be undertaken even without prior experience.

We invite you to come with your partner or friends to partake in this adventurous activity in close contact with nature. It's an opportunity not only to experience the thrill but also to meet like-minded individuals who enjoy such activities.

This location is near Ciudad Colón, approximately 20 minutes from El Rodeo. Accessible by car without any issues.

At the end of the tour, we'll enjoy a delicious typical lunch at a local restaurant, where we'll also have the chance to change into dry clothes brought for this purpose.
